This project implements a versatile chatbot named J.A.D.E. leveraging the Gemini API for natural language processing, built with Python, HTML, and CSS.

# Description

J.A.D.E. provides a user-friendly interface for text-based interaction. It seamlessly integrates with the Gemini API, enabling it to understand user queries, generate informative responses, and potentially engage in more complex conversations (depending on your implementation).

# Features

Text-Based Chat Interface: Users can interact with J.A.D.E. through a convenient text input field, making communication intuitive.
Gemini API Integration: The project incorporates the powerful Gemini API, empowering J.A.D.E. to process and interpret user queries effectively.
Customizable Behavior (Optional): With further development, you can tailor J.A.D.E.'s responses and actions to suit your specific needs and use cases.
Installation

# Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Flask framework (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/installation/)

Gemini API access (requires a Google Maker Suite account)

# Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Rio2802/J.A.D.E.git
Use code with caution.

Setting Up Virtual Environment (Optional, Recommended):
Using a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other system-wide Python installations. Here's how to create and activate one:

Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS or venv\Scripts\activate.bat for Windows
Use code with caution.

# Installing Dependencies:
Once your virtual environment is activated (if applicable), install the required libraries using pip:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Usage

# Configuration (Optional):

If your J.A.D.E. chatbot requires a Gemini API key, you might need to set it up as an environment variable or within a configuration file. Refer to the project's code or any additional instructions for specific guidance.
Running the Chatbot:
Start the chatbot application using the following command:

Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.

This will typically launch the chatbot server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

# Interacting with J.A.D.E.:
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser. You should see a user interface where you can enter text and interact with J.A.D.E.

# Development

This project is open-source, and we welcome contributions! Here's how you can get involved:

Code Structure: The codebase is organized into clear modules (e.g., Python file for core logic, separate HTML/CSS files for the user interface). Feel free to explore the code to understand its functionality.
Contributing Guidelines: Refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file (if provided) for detailed instructions on how to submit code changes, report issues, or suggest improvements.
